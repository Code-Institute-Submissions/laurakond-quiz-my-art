### Wireframes
The following wireframe mockups show initial idea of how the website would look on three different devices: mobile, tablets and laptops/desktops.

#### Mobile

#### Tablet

## Features

The website is comprised of blank pages: a Home page, a blank page, a blank page and an Error 404 page. The latter is hidden from the user, and is only visible when a wrong website address is entered. 

All features are fully responsive on mobile, tablets/iPads, laptops and desktops. 

### Existing features

**The Header**

**The Footer**

<br>

**The Home page**



<br>  

**History & Technique page**. This page is split into three sections including a list of cross-stitching steps to follow and a video. 



<br>

**Portfolio Gallery** page is divided into two sections that allow the user to easily identify the type of cross-stitch projects are currently underway and which are completed. 


<br>

**404 Error page** has been included in case there are any bugs that prevent the website or links from working properly. 
- The page has a stylised link that clearly indicates interactivity and takes the user back to the Home page of the website.

### Features Left to Implement


### Accessibility

  - I have followed good standard accessibility practices by including the following:
	  - I used semantic HTML.
	  - I included descriptive atl attributes to used images. 
	  - I marked the current page with the "current" attribute to ensure that screen readers indicate it to the users.
	  - I provided descriptive information for the screen readers where icons were used.
	  - I ensured that sufficient color contrast is provided when choosing the color palette.
