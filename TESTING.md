### Accessibility

  - I have followed good standard accessibility practices by including the following:
	  - I used semantic HTML.
	  - I included descriptive atl attributes to used images. 
	  - I marked the current page with the "current" attribute to ensure that screen readers indicate it to the users.
	  - I provided descriptive information for the screen readers where icons were used.
	  - I ensured that sufficient color contrast is provided when choosing the color palette.
